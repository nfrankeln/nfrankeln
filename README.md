ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nfrankeln
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested learning all the diffrent aspects of computer programming. 
   In my spare time I like listening to litrpg audiobooks and playing my favorite battle royale, Apex legends
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using FreeCodeCamp to learn html,css, and javascript and 
   Harvard's CS 50 course to learn about a broad range of computer science topics
   Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple front end projects
   
   Update:
   Its been about 6 months since I started. Since then I have learned the basics of HTML,CSS and JS.
   I am also attending a programming boocamp called CODE PLATOON.
