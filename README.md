ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nfrankeln
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested learning all the diffrent aspects of computer programming. 
   In my spare time I like listening to litrpg audiobooks and playing my favorite battle royale, Apex legends
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using FreeCodeCamp to learn html,css, and javascript and 
   Harvard's CS 50 course to learn about a broad range of computer science topics
   Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple front end projects
   
### Update 1:
Its been about 4 months since I started. Since then I have learned the basics of HTML,CSS and JS.
I am also attending a programming boocamp called CODE PLATOON. 

### Update 2: 
  I have just graduated from CODE PLATOON. It was a valuable experiance. Some of the new skills I learned were Python,Django,React,Postgresql.

### Update 3: 
   I deployed my first project [Carjamz](https://nf-carjamz.com/) 

   To test it out 
   - 1) sign into a demo account username: carjamzdemo@gmail.com password: demo
   - 2) search for another user i.e ntnyfranky@gmail.com

Until spotify gives me a quota extension this app is locked in development mode and I have to whitelist spotify users manually.
So if you want to try it out with your own spotify account/a freinds account just shoot me a message


    
   ### Update 4:
Started exploring more frontend tools and frameworks

completed a [mini dog adoption website](https://stellar-sprinkles-826280.netlify.app/)
      
The login component doesnt actually save your email or name

   ### Update 5 
Spent 2 weeks getting familiar with figma and now Im starting to learn JAVA!
My next project will be a web app for a local charity Im so excited!

   ### Update 6 

   Been about a year since I posted. Been working at my first job as a dev might do some more projects might not idk cio
